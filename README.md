# 🔢 Task #1 - Number Divisibility Checker

A JavaScript program that checks how many numbers (2, 3, or 5) a given number is divisible by.

## 📋 Task Requirements

Write a program that defines a number (e.g., `const num = 123`). The program checks and prints for the given number:

**a.** If the number is divisible by 2 OR 3 OR 5 → print **1** (divisible by only one number)

**b.** If the number is divisible by 2 AND 3, OR 3 AND 5, OR 2 AND 5 → print **2** (divisible by exactly two numbers)

**c.** If the number is divisible by 2 AND 3 AND 5 → print **3** (divisible by all three numbers)

## ⚠️ Constraints

- **NO `if` statements** or other control structures allowed
- **MUST use logical operations** as required in JavaScript lessons
- Note: Logical operations return boolean type. You can convert it to a number using `Number(value)`
  - `Number(true)` returns `1`
  - `Number(false)` returns `0`
- Print only **one result**

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
node Task1.js
```
